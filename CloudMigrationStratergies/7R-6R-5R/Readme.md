The **5R, 6R, and 7R models** are variations of the same cloud migration framework, with minor differences based on how AWS and other cloud providers have evolved their recommendations. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of their differences:

---

### **1. The Original "5R" Model (AWS Early Version)**
Introduced by **Gartner** and later adopted by AWS, the **5Rs** were the foundational strategies for cloud migration:
1. **Rehost** (Lift & Shift)  
2. **Refactor** (Re-architect)  
3. **Revise** (Modify before migration)  
4. **Rebuild** (Replace with cloud-native)  
5. **Replace** (Drop & shop for SaaS)  

**Missing in 5R:**  
- No explicit **Retire** or **Retain** (later added in 6R/7R).  
- "Revise" was later split into **Replatform** (6R) and **Relocate** (7R).  

---

### **2. The "6R" Model (AWS Expanded Version)**
AWS expanded the 5R to **6R** by adding **Retire** and adjusting terminology:
1. **Rehost** (Lift & Shift)  
2. **Replatform** (Lift, Tinker & Shift)  
3. **Refactor** (Re-architect for cloud-native)  
4. **Repurchase** (Replace with SaaS)  
5. **Retire** (Decommission unused apps)  
6. **Retain** (Keep on-prem/hybrid)  

**Key Changes from 5R:**  
- **"Revise"** ‚Üí Split into **Replatform** (minor optimizations) and **Repurchase** (SaaS).  
- Added **Retire** (cost optimization) and **Retain** (hybrid cloud).

### **3. The "7R" Model (AWS Latest Version)**
AWS further refined the model by adding **Relocate** (for VMware migrations):
1. **Rehost**  
2. **Replatform**  
3. **Refactor**  
4. **Repurchase**  
5. **Retire**  
6. **Retain**  
7. **Relocate** (Move VMware workloads to AWS without rehosting)  

**Key Addition in 7R:**  
- **Relocate** ‚Üí Specifically for **VMware Cloud on AWS**, allowing hypervisor-level migration.

### **Comparison Table: 5R vs. 6R vs. 7R**
| Strategy       | **5R** (Gartner/AWS Early) | **6R** (AWS Standard) | **7R** (AWS Latest) |  
|---------------|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|  
| **Lift & Shift** | Rehost ‚úÖ | Rehost ‚úÖ | Rehost ‚úÖ |  
| **Minor Optimizations** | Revise (vague) | Replatform ‚úÖ | Replatform ‚úÖ |  
| **Cloud-Native** | Refactor ‚úÖ | Refactor ‚úÖ | Refactor ‚úÖ |  
| **SaaS Replacement** | Replace ‚úÖ | Repurchase ‚úÖ | Repurchase ‚úÖ |  
| **Decommission Apps** | ‚ùå | Retire ‚úÖ | Retire ‚úÖ |  
| **Hybrid Cloud** | ‚ùå | Retain ‚úÖ | Retain ‚úÖ |  
| **VMware Migration** | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Relocate ‚úÖ |

### **Which One Should You Use?**
- **5R** ‚Üí Rarely used today; mostly historical.  
- **6R** ‚Üí Most common in AWS docs (covers 90% of cases).  
- **7R** ‚Üí Needed if migrating **VMware workloads** to AWS.  

**AWS‚Äôs official docs now mostly reference the 6R**, but **7R** is used in VMware-specific guides.
