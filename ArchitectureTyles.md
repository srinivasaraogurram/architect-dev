"As-is" refers to an application or data being migrated to a new environment without any changes, while "lift and shift" is a cloud migration strategy that involves moving applications and data to the cloud as-is, and "shift left" is a practice of moving testing, security, and other quality checks earlier in the development lifecycle. [1, 2, 3]  
As-Is: [1, 1, 2, 2]  

• This term describes the state of an application or data when it's migrated to a new environment without any modifications or changes to its structure or functionality. [1, 1, 2]  
• It's a common approach in cloud migration, where applications are simply "lifted" from one environment and "shifted" to another, without any refactoring or redesign. [1, 1, 4, 4]  

Lift and Shift: [1, 4, 5]  

• A cloud migration strategy where applications and their associated data are moved to a new environment (typically the cloud) without any changes to the application code or infrastructure. [1, 4, 5]  
• It's also known as "rehosting". [4, 5]  
• This approach is attractive for its speed and lower upfront costs, as it avoids the need for extensive application changes. [4, 6]  

Shift Left: [2, 3]  

• A practice that emphasizes moving testing, security, and other quality checks earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). [2, 3]  
• This approach aims to identify and address potential issues early on, rather than waiting until later stages of development or deployment. [3]  
• In DevSecOps, shift left means embedding security practices early in the application development process, identifying vulnerable code as it is developed, rather than in the testing phase. [3, 7]  
• Shift left testing means testing earlier in the software development process. [8, 9, 10]  
• In data integration, shift left means performing data processing and governance earlier in the stream, reducing bad data proliferation, storage and compute needs in downstream systems. [2, 11]
